# Common LinkedList Operations Time Complexity

LinkedList is a popular data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Here are the time complexities of some common operations performed on a LinkedList:

1. **Insertion at the beginning**: O(1)
    - Inserting a node at the beginning of a LinkedList takes constant time, as it involves updating the reference of the new node to point to the current head node, and updating the head reference to point to the new node.

2. **Insertion at the end**: O(1) or O(n)
    - If the LinkedList maintains a reference to the tail node, inserting a node at the end can be done in constant time by updating the reference of the current tail node to point to the new node, and updating the tail reference to point to the new node. However, if the tail reference is not maintained, inserting at the end requires traversing the entire LinkedList, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

3. **Insertion at a specific position**: O(n)
    - Inserting a node at a specific position in a LinkedList requires traversing the LinkedList until reaching the desired position, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

4. **Deletion at the beginning**: O(1)
    - Deleting the first node in a LinkedList takes constant time, as it involves updating the head reference to point to the next node.

5. **Deletion at the end**: O(n)
    - Deleting the last node in a LinkedList requires traversing the entire LinkedList until reaching the second-to-last node, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

6. **Deletion at a specific position**: O(n)
    - Deleting a node at a specific position in a LinkedList requires traversing the LinkedList until reaching the node before the desired position, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

7. **Searching for a value**: O(n)
    - Searching for a specific value in a LinkedList requires traversing the entire LinkedList until finding the node with the desired value, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

It's important to note that these time complexities assume a singly LinkedList implementation. Doubly LinkedLists have similar time complexities, but with some additional considerations for updating previous node references.
